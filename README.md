# hangman_gui
I previously made a word guessing game that was played in the terminal, then I repurposed some of that code to make this game. Rather than keying in input, the user presses the button of the letter they want to guess and the progress updates accordingly. With each wrong guess, the image of the hangman updates to show another body part. Once the user wins the game or runs out of guesses, a messagebox pops up prompting the user to start another round or end the game. Each round within a single session will be a different word as long as the number of rounds played is less than or equal to the number of words in the file referenced.
